Apple Pie Lab using Swift and Xcode

“Your project is to write a game called Apple Pie. In this simple word-guessing game, each player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word. Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling off the tree. The player wins by guessing the word correctly before all the apples are gone.
